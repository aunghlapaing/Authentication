2. Read || Select || Search
   select all: SELECT * FROM <table_name>
   select individual: SELECT <table_field_name> FROM <table_name>
   select individaul condition: SELECT <table_field_name> FROM <table_name> WHERE <table_field_name>='value', <table_field_name>='value'

3. Delete || Remove
   delete all: DELETE FROM <table_name>
   delete individaul: DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <table_field_name>='value'

4. Update || Upgrade
   Update: UPDATE <table_name> SET <table_field_name>='update_value' , <table_field_name>='update_value'

5. Sorting || Order by
   Sorting: SELECT * FROM <table_name> ORDER BY <table_field_name> as ASC or DESC

6. Pagination || Limit

RBBMS (Relational Database Management System)
- --------------------------------------- - 

Table Join
- ------------- - 
1. Join
SELECT * FROM <tabel1_name> JOIN <table2_name> ON <table1.id> = <table2.table1_id>;

2. Left Join
SELECT * FROM subject LEFT JOIN student ON subject_id = student_id;

3. Right Join
SELECT * FROM subject RIGHT JOIN student ON subject_id = student_id;

4. Full Join
SELECT * FROM subject FULL OUTER JOIN student ON subject_id = student_id;

Relationship Type
- ------------------ -
